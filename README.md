# Crop Recommendation System

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection based on environmental and soil conditions. This system predicts the most suitable crops for a given set of parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, pH level, humidity, temperature, and rainfall level. By providing accurate crop recommendations, it aims to optimize yields and maximize profitability for farmers.

## How it Works

The Crop Recommendation System utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical data of crop yields and environmental conditions. The model is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships between input parameters and recommended crops.

## Input Parameters

1. Nitrogen: The amount of nitrogen present in the soil.
2. Phosphorus: The amount of phosphorus present in the soil.
3. pH Level: The acidity or alkalinity level of the soil.
4. Humidity: The level of moisture present in the air.
5. Temperature: The temperature of the environment.
6. Rainfall Level: The amount of rainfall in the area.

## Output

The system provides a recommended crop based on the input parameters provided. This recommendation is determined by the machine learning model's analysis of historical data and its understanding of how different crops perform under various environmental conditions.

## Usage

To use the Crop Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Input the values of nitrogen, phosphorus, pH level, humidity, temperature, and rainfall level into the system.
2. Run the system.
3. The system will output the recommended crop based on the provided parameters.
